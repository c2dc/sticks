  "description": "[Pikabot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1145) was distributed in [Water Curupira Pikabot Distribution](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0037) throughout 2023 by an entity linked to BlackBasta ransomware deployment via email attachments. This activity followed the take-down of [QakBot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0650), with several technical overlaps and similarities with [QakBot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0650), indicating a possible connection. The identified activity led to the deployment of tools such as [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154), while coinciding with campaigns delivering [DarkGate](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1111) and [IcedID](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0483) en route to ransomware deployment.(Citation: TrendMicro Pikabot 2024)\n\nAlso known as: Water Curupira Pikabot Distribution",
